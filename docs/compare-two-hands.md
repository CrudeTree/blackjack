Once both player and dealer have their final cards:

Sum up both player hand and dealer hand.

Subtract dealer hand from player hand.

If dealer has 21, dealer wins.

If player value has > 21 all player hand Aces are equal to 1.

If dealer value has > 21 all dealer hand Aces are equal to 1.

Re-Sum player and dealer hand.

If value is negative and dealer > 21, player wins.

If value is positive and player hand < 22, player wins.

If value is negative and player hand < 22, dealer wins.

If value is 0 and both player and dealer are < 22, push.
